# WORLD HAPPINESS REPORT
## Objective
I would like to explore the data related to the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) through visualisations, on the following areas:
1. Is there an evolution of the Happiness Score over the period of 2015 – 2019 ?
2. Is “Economy” the most  decisive factor of the Happiness Score ?
3. Is the World Bank's "Income Share" index correlated with Happiness Score ?
